# Pawpal

A simple GitHub Pages site containing HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. This repository appears focused on static front-end content (HTML ~53%, CSS ~41%, JavaScript ~6%).

## Live Demo
If GitHub Pages is enabled for this repository, the site will be available at:
(https://pawpal-umber.vercel.app/index.html)
(If the URL is different, check the repository Pages settings.)

## Tech stack
- HTML (primary)
- CSS (styling)
- JavaScript (small interactive bits)

## Project structure
A typical layout for this repo might look like:
- index.html — main entry page
- assets/
  - css/ — stylesheets
  - js/ — scripts
  - images/ — images and icons
- pages/ or other HTML files for additional pages

Adjust the structure above to match the actual files in the repository.

## Local development / Preview
You can preview the site locally with a lightweight static server.

Using Python 3:
```bash
# from the repo root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Using Node (http-server):
```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
```

## How to update
1. Edit the HTML/CSS/JS files in the repository.
2. Commit and push changes to the default branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
3. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild/serve the updated site if Pages is enabled.

If you prefer a dedicated deployment branch:
- Push the build to a `gh-pages` branch and configure Pages to use that branch in the repository settings.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome.
- Open an issue to discuss large changes or feature requests.
- For small fixes, open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

Suggested PR checklist:
- [ ] Confirm visual/layout changes in multiple screen sizes
- [ ] Confirm no console errors in browser devtools
- [ ] Include screenshots for UI changes (if applicable)

## Notes & TODO
- Add a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT) if you want an explicit license.
- Add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT and CONTRIBUTING.md if you expect outside contributors.
- Consider adding basic tests (HTML validation / CSS linting) or an automated workflow for formatting.
